### Example of integrating Salt Edge API with JavaScript.

* To run this code, you need a simple http server that will serve all the content. You can use **python -m SimpleHTTPServer**.

* Go to your [Salt Edge profile settings](https://www.saltedge.com/clients/profile/edit), and set in field **home url** the url of the app to your external ip, so that CORS requests will be allowed by the Salt Edge API

* Open the address provided by the http server.

* Go to [Profile Data Secrets](https://www.saltedge.com/clients/profile/secrets) and Copy Paste data to JavaScript Application Page.

* Now you can connect your banks and receive data.
